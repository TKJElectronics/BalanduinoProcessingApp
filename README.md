This is the code I used to find the proper PID values or control the robot and see the IMU data on a graph.
This enables you to change the PID values wirelessly without needing to reprogram the robot each time.

It can also be used to control the robot via the keyboard.

To communicate with the robot you need to select your serial port in the dropdown menu and then press on the button labeled connect.

The program is intended to be used with a Bluetooth serial port, but can be used with any serial port you like.

More information can be found at our Kickstarter campaign: <http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tkjelectronics/balanduino-balancing-robot-kit>.

The source code for the robot can be found at the following link: <https://github.com/TKJElectronics/Balanduino>.
