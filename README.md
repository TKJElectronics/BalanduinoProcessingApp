This is the code I used to find the proper PID values or control the robot and see the IMU data on a graph.
This enables you to change the PID values wirelessly without needing to reprogram the robot each time.

It can also be used to control the robot via the keyboard.

More information can be found at our Kickstarter campaign: <http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tkjelectronics/balanduino-balancing-robot-kit>.

The source code for the robot will released as soon as the Kickstarter campaign is finished.

A video for the Kickstarter presentation of the robot can be found here: <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kQniPbg9zc>.

A video filmed with a GoPro mounted on the robot: <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvFcnb_9anM>.
